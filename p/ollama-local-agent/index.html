Geez.</p><p>At least, that&rsquo;s how it felt when I begrudgingly decided to look at running some models locally.</p><p>A few months ago, I decided to have a look at <a class=link href=/dev-blog/p/cursor-vibe-check/>vibe coding with Cursor</a>. Now, I&rsquo;ll have to admit that I went into that experiment fairly biased despite my best efforts to keep an open mind, but I walked away not very impressed and with the notion that AI was over-hyped even further cemented in my mind.</p><p>Given a few months and some more poking around with GitHub Copilot, and I think I&rsquo;m ready to say that while I&rsquo;m still quite bearish on AI in general, it has certainly found a place in my workflow. Unfortunately, I have experienced some frustration with it — largely along the lines of running out of Claude requests and being left with GPT, which would at times just seemingly disconnect and wouldn&rsquo;t return to working order until I restarted VS Code.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also the whole privacy concern. Personally I find myself unbothered by it, but in the context of customer data I am <em>very</em> cautious about the implications.</p><p>Anyway, waking up with a &ldquo;what do I want to look into today&rdquo; landed me on the topic of running AI models locally.</p><h2 id=getting-started>Getting started</h2><div class=alert>Tip: Install with <code>brew install ollama</code> and then run <code>ollama</code> to see the available commands.</div><p>No surprises that I landed here. Even as someone who has had my head half-buried in the sand when it comes to AI, I was well aware of <a class=link href=https://ollama.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Ollama</a>. A bit of light searching yielded alternatives, but I decided early on that I was just going to stick with the basics here.</p><p>Installation was a breeze, just needing a quick <code>brew install ollama</code> to install it locally. Once installed, calling <code>ollama</code> by itself shows us the relatively simple set of commands we can pass it, but to get started there&rsquo;s only a couple we really need.</p><p>First of all though, to start the Ollama server run <code>ollama serve</code>.</p><h2 id=models>Models</h2><p>The basic commands we&rsquo;re after here are <code>ollama run</code>, <code>ollama list</code> and <code>ollama rm</code> to run a model, list all models, and remove models.</p><p>The Ollama <a class=link href=https://ollama.com/search target=_blank rel=noopener>models page</a> details a slew of models that we can run.</p><p><img src=/dev-blog/p/ollama-local-agent/images/ollama-models.png width=3196 height=1344 srcset="/dev-blog/p/ollama-local-agent/images/ollama-models_hu_ab4c77a0f4b79ffa.png 480w, /dev-blog/p/ollama-local-agent/images/ollama-models_hu_f9293d5b5a2b22e7.png 1024w" loading=lazy class=gallery-image data-flex-grow=237 data-flex-basis=570px></p><p>Actually installing and running a model is as simple as calling <code>ollama run llama3.1</code>. This will download it if it hasn&rsquo;t yet been pulled, and runs it immediately. Once installed, we can start typing prompts into the terminal!</p><h3 id=choosing-a-model>Choosing a model</h3><p>I&rsquo;m not going to go too in-depth here — mostly because I still don&rsquo;t really understand it! I&rsquo;ll give it a red-hot crack anyway.</p><p>Looking at the list of available models, I saw a bunch of options and was completely lost as to which I needed. Looking at this heavily truncated list below, I was confused as to which I should use. Especially since there we easily 60+ variants to choose from!</p><ul><li><code>llama3.1:405b-text-fp16</code></li><li><code>llama3.1:70b-text-q3_K_S</code></li><li><code>llama3.1:8b-instruct-q5_K_M</code></li></ul><p>Anyway, after a bit of reading I was able to break it down to the following, using <code>llama3.1:8b-instruct-q5_K_M</code> as a reference.</p><ul><li><code>llama3.1</code> — the name of the model, each may be better or worse at some things.</li><li><code>8b</code> — the number of parameters the model contains. Roughly, the &ldquo;size&rdquo; of the model.</li><li><code>instruct</code> — the purpose of the model, which generally is the main function of that model.</li><li><code>q5_K_M</code> — the model&rsquo;s quantization, or roughly, level of optimisation.</li></ul><p>The Ollama GitHub repository also provided this helpful note, providing some guidelines around system resource requirements for different model sizes.</p><div class=alert>You should have at least 8 GB of RAM available to run the 7B models, 16 GB to run the 13B models, and 32 GB to run the 33B models.</div><p>To expand slightly on quantization as that was a completely new term for me, quantization is the process of converting a model&rsquo;s weights from high precision data types to lower precision types. While this generally translates to a smaller resource footprint, it comes at the cost of a potential reduction in accuracy and quality.</p><p>Models can get even more complex than that, and I found <a class=link href=https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/04/03/how-navigate-llm-model-names# target=_blank rel=noopener>this page</a> does a good job of explaining the terms without going too deep. In fact, it&rsquo;s just about where I pulled that little quantization explainer from.</p><p>Personally, I landed on the <code>qwen2.5-coder:3b-instruct-q4_K_M</code> and <code>qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct-q4_K_M</code> models. The 3B model was nice and quick, and seemed to handle most basic tasks with ease. I did find myself frequently switching to the 7B model when the smaller one wasn&rsquo;t quite doing the job.</p><p>I also spent about half an hour looking at new PCs.</p><h2 id=open-webui>Open WebUI</h2><p>As nice as it is to be able to start running models locally with such ease, the interface leaves a little to be desired.</p><p><a class=link href=https://openwebui.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Open WebUI</a> offers us a much nicer way to interact with our models — even allowing us to run multiple models side-by-side, which is perfect for comparing the output of various models.</p><p><img src=/dev-blog/p/ollama-local-agent/images/open-webui.png width=3202 height=1254 srcset="/dev-blog/p/ollama-local-agent/images/open-webui_hu_7e9e6274501ac640.png 480w, /dev-blog/p/ollama-local-agent/images/open-webui_hu_4960c48fea60d14f.png 1024w" loading=lazy class=gallery-image data-flex-grow=255 data-flex-basis=612px></p><p>Running the following should both pull and start the docker container.

I&rsquo;ve spent long enough bragging about how well my decision to go with a MacBook Air has been, and after about a year and a half I finally ran into the thing that made me wish I had a little more grunt under the hood.</p><p>Even some of the smallest models were slow enough to be a little annoying, and those that didn&rsquo;t have smaller varieties were just slower than I would consider to be usable. Certainly, with no qualms about GPT harvesting my data, I was not about to pump the brakes on whatever thinking was going on under the hood.</p><p>I decided to flick open my dusty old Windows laptop (in fact it&rsquo;s neither dusty nor old, currently it serves as my game streaming server using <a class=link href=https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine target=_blank rel=noopener>Sunlight</a>) and install Ollama there.</p><p>Woah. Okay, now we&rsquo;re running at what looked like 3-4x faster. Turns out having a GPU kinda helps.</p><h2 id=ollama-over-the-network>Ollama over the network</h2><p>Cool. So we&rsquo;ve got a fast-enough-to-be-usable machine running AI models. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t actually do any work on that laptop — it&rsquo;s pretty much dedicated to gaming* these days. That said, I&rsquo;d had a taste of how the models <em>should</em> be running, and I couldn&rsquo;t look back.</p><p><em>* by which I mean, of course, the times I&rsquo;d love to be playing games if life could just stop throwing me side quests</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m certainly no network buff, and I chose the path of least resistance. I quickly installed <a class=link href=https://ngrok.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>ngrok</a> and exposed my Ollama endpoint (<code>http://localhost:11434</code>) to see if it was workable. Navigating to the endpoint that ngrok assigned for me, and I could see the very simple page that told me Ollama was running. Sweet!</p><p>Now, I really should clean this up — since I only intend to use this while I&rsquo;m sitting within arm&rsquo;s reach of both laptops, I really could just serve this over my local network. For the sake of experimentation, however, that&rsquo;s tomorrow&rsquo;s problem.</p><h3 id=open-webui-1>Open WebUI</h3><p>I guess this one can come first since we&rsquo;ve already talked about setting it up.</p><p>Since I already had this up and running on my MacBook, I just needed to pop into the settings. Under the option for <strong>Connections</strong> there is a section called <strong>Manage Direct Connections</strong>. This is where we can add the URL of our Ollama server.</p><p>With a bit of trial and error, I found that I needed to append the ngrok-provided URL with <code>/v1</code> to get it working. It should pick up the models automatically, although they can be specified explicitly if we want.</p><p>Alternatively, the likely easier way to achieve this would be to simply specify the <code>OLLAMA_BASE_URL</code> while we&rsquo;re creating the container, by adding <code>-e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=</code> to the previous command. Here&rsquo;s the command again, but you&rsquo;ll need to replace the URL with your own.</p><p>Note that this approach does <strong>not</strong> require us to append the URL with <code>v1</code>.</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

Wiring it up to Ollama running on a different computer proved to be a little less obvious, and fortunately I stumbled across a relevant <a class=link href=https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/156483 target=_blank rel=noopener>GitHub discussion</a>.</p><p>The TL;DR for the above is that we&rsquo;re looking for a setting called <code>github.copilot.chat.byok.ollamaEndpoint</code>. Throwing my ngrok endpoint at that setting allowed me to select the models running on my other machine.</p><p>The only annoyance I found with this is that I had two different sizes of the same model, and GitHub Copilot&rsquo;s interface just showed the same display name for each of them. As a workaround, it looks like I could possibly use a Modelfile to give my models better names, but that opened yet another door — and a welcome one at that.</p><h2 id=modelfiles>Modelfiles</h2><p>Basically, one of the things I&rsquo;ve disliked is this idea that I have a generic AI helper that I constantly need to keep feeding cues to. I have a coding style, and part of what has been turning me away from AI is that it won&rsquo;t write the code that I want it to write!</p><p>While, yes, in the context of GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc., I can just throw a set of rules at it, I disliked the notion that I would need to maintain this on a per-project basis, constantly re-synchronising them with my other projects&mldr; Nope. That&rsquo;s not saving me time.</p><p>So, I started looking into custom models. Here&rsquo;s the <a class=link href=https://ollama.readthedocs.io/en/modelfile/#examples target=_blank rel=noopener>Modelfile reference</a>, which goes into a lot more detail than I have below.</p><div class=code-hint-block><span class=code-hint-path></span><span class=code-hint>svelte-assistant.Modelfile</span></div><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

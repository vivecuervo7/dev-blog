<time class=article-time--reading>31 minute read</time></div></footer></div></header><section class=article-content><p>A little over a week ago, I started toying with <a class=link href=/dev-blog/p/ollama-local-agent/>running Large Language Models (LLMs) locally using Ollama</a>.</p><p>Apparently, all that did was to get my head spinning with a few ideas. Largely, I was finding myself incredibly curious about the potential of running some of those smaller LLMs locally, and having each of them specialised in a specific domain.</p><p>For context, I should probably clarify how I tend to find myself using LLMs.</p><h2 id=the-use-case>The use case</h2><p>I did have <a class=link href=/dev-blog/p/cursor-vibe-check/>a bit of a play with genuine vibe coding</a>, but quickly found that it wasn&rsquo;t for me. I like understanding my codebase, and while certainly impressive that it could churn out functional code it a matter of minutes, I found it more often than not generated <em>too</em> much. I found the sheer amount of code difficult to meaningfully review, and more often than not found myself blowing away all the changes even after a good half hour or so of prompting.</p><p>AI has still found a home in my workflow however, but I find my use case to be mostly based around &ldquo;I want this very specific thing, and I want it done roughly like this&rdquo;. At a high level my workflow looks more like this:</p><ul><li>Creating a database migration<ul><li>Manually create the file, add to context</li><li>Prompt: <em>Add a migration that adds a <code>users</code> table with <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>email</code> columns</em></li></ul></li><li>Creating the model / entity file<ul><li>Manually create the file, add to context</li><li>Add the migration file we created earlier to context</li><li>Prompt: <em>Create an entity that reflects this newly created table</em></li></ul></li></ul><p>&mldr;and so on.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a bit of manual work to say &ldquo;this is where I want you to put the code&rdquo;, and then letting AI run away with the code that needs to be added to that specific file. Which means, usually I want it to <em>specifically</em> write SQL, or add a new SvelteKit endpoint, or maybe append a route to a .NET controller.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not really leveraging the capabilities of a model that is generally knowledgeable in all these things, all at once.</p><h3 id=the-pain-point>The pain point</h3><p>Honestly, this approach has been working for me. It very quickly gives me a chunk of code that is small enough to either quickly tick off or tweak to my liking, and then I can move on and not need to think about that file again.</p><p>The problem I have consistently run into however, is that the training for most (all?) of these LLMs was done prior to the release of Svelte 5. And Svelte 5 brought significant changes to the syntax. As one can imagine, this amounted to a <em>lot</em> of generated code that was just&mldr; wrong.</p><h3 id=the-litmus-test>The litmus test</h3><p>Given that very clear and resounding pain point, I settled on one specific thing I wanted to achieve — something that the models I was using were just completely incapable of in their current state.</p><blockquote><p>Could I teach a model how to write in Svelte 5&rsquo;s syntax?</p></blockquote><p>With my thoughts already occupied with this idea of having a handful of specialised, smaller LLMs, I figured this would be the perfect test.</p><h3 id=the-potential-solutions>The potential solutions</h3><p>There were a few different ways I could go about trying to solve this problem. To date, I hadn&rsquo;t really leaned too heavily on GitHub Copilot&rsquo;s instructions files, but I figured it would be the first stop.</p><p>While that seemed a sane approach, I was very conscious of the fact that using smaller LLMs, I probably needed to be careful with context lengths. While this was likely less of a concern given my short-lived interactions with the LLM, it still felt like a sub-par solution.</p><p>Enter a couple of terms that I had seen bandied about, but really at this point hadn&rsquo;t understood. Namely, <strong>system prompts</strong>, <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> and <strong>fine-tuning</strong>.</p><h3 id=the-reference-material>The reference material</h3><p>After spending half a day trying to get an LLM to scrape some meaningful data off the Svelte documentation website, I discovered that the Svelte website actually has a page <a class=link href=https://svelte.dev/docs/llms target=_blank rel=noopener>specific to LLMs</a>.</p><p><img src=/dev-blog/p/fine-tuning-an-llm/images/homer-doh.gif width=480 height=366 srcset="/dev-blog/p/fine-tuning-an-llm/images/homer-doh_hu_60082b7e6811f324.gif 480w, /dev-blog/p/fine-tuning-an-llm/images/homer-doh_hu_66b249c1b3afcd6.gif 1024w" loading=lazy alt="Not the last time I found myself saying that." class=gallery-image data-flex-grow=131 data-flex-basis=314px></p><p>I also discovered that this <code>llms.txt</code> file is a <a class=link href=https://llmstxt.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>proposed standard</a>, and there&rsquo;s a <a class=link href=https://directory.llmstxt.cloud/ target=_blank rel=noopener>handy directory of products and companies</a> that have adopted it.</p><p>Awesome! What really got me interested, however, was the presence of some text files that had the complete documentation, including compressed versions for smaller LLMs.</p><ul><li><a class=link href=https://svelte.dev/llms.txt target=_blank rel=noopener>/llms.txt</a> — a listing of the available files</li><li><a class=link href=https://svelte.dev/llms-full.txt target=_blank rel=noopener>/llms-full.txt</a> (~1 MB) — complete documentation for Svelte, SvelteKit and the CLI</li><li><a class=link href=https://svelte.dev/llms-medium.txt target=_blank rel=noopener>/llms-medium.txt</a> (~0.5 MB) — compressed documentation for use with medium context windows</li><li><a class=link href=https://svelte.dev/llms-small.txt target=_blank rel=noopener>/llms-small.txt</a> (45 KB) — highly compressed documentation for use with smaller context windows</li></ul><h2 id=github-copilot-instructions>GitHub Copilot instructions</h2><p>I won&rsquo;t go too deep on this one. The short version is that, <a class=link href=https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions target=_blank rel=noopener>following the documentation</a>, I was able to essentially paste the contents of the <code>llms-*.txt</code> file into <code>copilot-instructions.md</code>. I actually got some really positive results with this approach. Certainly, once plugged into a fully-scaffolded project, it was able to generate some fairly accurate code.</p><p>Surprisingly however, I got far better results with the <em>smaller</em> <code>llms-small.txt</code> file, which was only 45 KB in size. I figure that this was likely due to the limited context window of the smaller models, although truthfully I didn&rsquo;t really know what to expect if I exceeded that — assuming this was even the case.</p><p>I definitely considered this to be a huge win, and honestly I could have likely stopped here.</p><p>In the spirit of full disclosure, I did run this with GPT and Claude as well, as the local models don&rsquo;t seem to be capable of actually generating files etc. Claude was unsurprisingly by far the standout here, but not without its problems. I&rsquo;ll summarise the experience with each of them below.</p><p>Generally speaking however, one pleasant experience was that I no longer needed to specify which framework the component needed to be written for. I used a very simple prompt of <em>&ldquo;Create a counter component&rdquo;</em>. These were all run via GitHub Copilot, with the scaffolded project loaded into VS Code.</p><div class=table-wrapper><table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Llama3.2 3B</td><td>This one pretty much flopped. The code it spat out didn&rsquo;t use Svelte 5 syntax, and didn&rsquo;t appear to even use <a class=link href=https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/legacy-reactive-assignments target=_blank rel=noopener>legacy reactive statements</a>. I&rsquo;m not being too critical of it at this point however, as it&rsquo;s easily the smallest model used.</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen 3 8B</td><td>I&rsquo;ve honestly found Qwen to be a little hit and miss in GitHub Copilot specifically, often getting caught up in it&rsquo;s reasoning, getting halfway through a <code>&lt;think></code> block and just&mldr; stopping. That said, the one time it actually generated the code I wanted, it was spot on and told me to put in in the correct place.</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-4.1</td><td>Created a <em>very</em> simple counter component, but put it in the wrong place. Additionally, it was initially created with botched <code>&lt;script></code> tags, and when it finished trying to fix them they were just gone — resulting in code that wouldn&rsquo;t even compile.</td></tr><tr><td>Claude Sonnet 4</td><td>I guess someone had to show off, and that someone was Claude. By a <em>long</em> way — but not necessarily in a <em>good</em> way. Claude checked the project structure, then created the component at the right location. All the correct syntax was used, even cross-referencing other components to confirm. But, in typical Claude fashion, the component was a big 240-line block of code complete with styling and all of the functionality that I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> want.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>I decided to push Claude a bit further here and managed to vibe code my way to a full-blown storefront for a shoe store. I was actually pretty surprised at how easily I could follow along this time — but truth be told, I have been working towards a very succinct stack which meant there was just less code to review. Styling however did get a bit messy, and there were a lot of follow-up prompts to try and get it Claude to keep that manageable.</p><p>And really, that latter point is one of the main reasons why I didn&rsquo;t want to just stop here. If I were to just continue with this pattern, I was going to be spending all my time fighting against Claude, trying to keep it in check.</p><p>Additionally, was I going to just keep needing to add more and more documentation to the instructions? Was there even an <code>llms-*.txt</code> file out there for Tailwind? How do I provide this same information to <a class=link href=https://openwebui.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Open WebUI</a>?</p><h2 id=retrieval-augmented-generation-rag>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</h2><p>I&rsquo;m going to be completely honest here — I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how this is supposed to work in the context of <em>both</em> GitHub Copilot and Open WebUI, especially when we&rsquo;re talking about having a highly-specialised model.</p><p>My end-goal here was to have a single, unified experience that would be consistent across both GitHub Copilot and Open WebUI. While conceptually speaking RAG isn&rsquo;t overly complex, the best I could really find here was to create a <a class=link href=https://docs.openwebui.com/features/workspace/knowledge/ target=_blank rel=noopener>knowledge base</a> in Open WebUI, and have it reference the knowledge base itself when generating for a prompt.</p><p>Open WebUI also allows us to <a class=link href=https://docs.openwebui.com/tutorials/tips/rag-tutorial#create-a-custom-model-with-the-knowledge-base target=_blank rel=noopener>create new models</a> that have a system prompt, as well as a constant reference to a knowledge base.</p><p>This actually worked <em>really</em> well, honestly. I wasn&rsquo;t sure that this was conceptually any different to GitHub Copilot&rsquo;s instructions, but it certainly did a far better job of just doing the thing I wanted it to do. Maybe GitHub Copilot was just getting in the way? Anyhow, it felt like the &ldquo;other side of the coin&rdquo; to GitHub Copilot&rsquo;s instructions, albeit a little shinier, despite not being plugged into my code editor.</p><p><img src=/dev-blog/p/fine-tuning-an-llm/images/open-webui-svelte.png width=927 height=377 srcset="/dev-blog/p/fine-tuning-an-llm/images/open-webui-svelte_hu_8bd6029dc63aaa87.png 480w, /dev-blog/p/fine-tuning-an-llm/images/open-webui-svelte_hu_384f695df27752e7.png 1024w" loading=lazy alt="qwen3:8b referencing the Svelte documentation’s llms-small.txt file" class=gallery-image data-flex-grow=245 data-flex-basis=590px></p><p>I should also note that when I tried to split up this file and provide it with a larger number of smaller files, it often struggled to find the <em>right</em> files and would start returning plainly incorrect responses. As with GitHub Copilot instructions, this just didn&rsquo;t offer a portable, consistent experience across different interfaces.</p><p>In the context of GitHub Copilot specifically, I had to keep telling it to look up the documentation, and even then it often just decided to do things it&rsquo;s own way.</p><h2 id=system-prompt>System prompt</h2><p>So, feeling like I&rsquo;d gotten <em>somewhere</em> with the two approaches above, I really wanted to try and consolidate this into a single, consistent model that both GitHub Copilot and Open WebUI could use.</p><p>Enter Ollama&rsquo;s Modelfiles. I <a class=link href=/dev-blog/p/ollama-local-agent/#modelfiles>touched on these briefly</a> while first looking into running models locally, but essentially they provide a way for me to create a completely new model based on an <em>existing</em> model, with some additional tweaks for things such as parameters, <strong>system prompts</strong> and templates. The Modelfile reference can be found <a class=link href=https://ollama.readthedocs.io/en/modelfile/ target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><p>Considering the success I&rsquo;d had with the two earlier approaches, I figured that what I really needed was to just have a model that always had this in context, right? That&rsquo;s effectively what was happening with the two separate approaches — although one was being very explicit in telling GitHub Copilot to <em>always</em> consider the instructions, and the other was giving Open WebUI access to the file and <em>hoping</em> that it always referenced it.</p><p>So, it seemed to make sense that I could just whack the contents of <code>llms-small.txt</code> into the system prompt of a new model, and then let both GitHub Copilot and Open WebUI use it directly, with no additional context required.</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

Not knowing too much about how GitHub Copilot&rsquo;s instructions or Open WebUI&rsquo;s RAG worked in terms of how much weight was given to the additional context, I figured that this might just have been applied a little differently.</p><p>In any case, this was a bit of a flop altogether.</p><h2 id=fine-tuning>Fine-tuning</h2><p>All of my reading up until this point had gradually leaned towards this eventuality. With my previous endeavours failing — or least not quite hitting the mark — I decided to look into what was actually required to fine-tune a model.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll try to touch on the various tools etc. in order here. This isn&rsquo;t quite how it panned out in practice, but it should provide a good overview of what&rsquo;s involved.</p><p>Additionally, I decided to move away from trying to train it on Svelte here. I did give it a good crack at first, with varying levels of success. Ultimately I was left unsure as to whether the dataset I had created was actually any good, or whether the models I was using were just too small. Different training methods added another variable into the mix, and on top of that, with Qwen 3 being a reasoning model I made a bit of a mess trying to insert reasoning data into the training dataset.</p><p>Anyway, I decided to train it on a much more focused topic — <strong>the dimensions and markings of a rugby league field</strong>.</p><p>I grabbed a PDF from <a class=link href=https://www.harrodsport.com/uploads/wysiwyg/file/rugby-league-pitch-dimensions-pdf.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>, and used that as the basis for my training dataset.</p><h3 id=datasets>Datasets</h3><p>Of course, the easiest way to create a dataset for training an LLM, was to use an LLM. I tried getting a couple of models to scrape the PDF, with ChatGPT being the quickest way to generate a large file.</p><h4 id=metas-synthetic-data-kit>Meta&rsquo;s Synthetic Data Kit</h4><p>I stumbled across <a class=link href=https://github.com/meta-llama/synthetic-data-kit target=_blank rel=noopener>Meta&rsquo;s Synthetic Data Kit</a> which is purpose built for creating these datasets <em>far</em> too late in the piece, however I found that I wasn&rsquo;t able to get a meaningful dataset anyhow. It simply required a model that was too large to run on my machine.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t go into details on how to run this, but it looks like an effective tool for slurping up large amounts of data and spitting out a usable dataset.</p><p>It just might need either a beefy setup, or using a rented workstation from services like <a class=link href=https://vast.ai/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Vast.ai</a>.</p><h4 id=formats>Formats</h4><p>The file itself needs to be a <code>jsonl</code> file, which is essentially a file with a JSON object per line.

A <code>test.jsonl</code> file is also recommended, which can be used to evaluate the model after training.</p><h3 id=mlx-lm>mlx-lm</h3><p>Using <code>mlx-lm</code> was actually one of the easier parts to get right.

It <em>does</em> however mean that the names might looks a little different to what we&rsquo;re used to seeing with Ollama, but rest assured they&rsquo;re all talking about the same models.</p><h4 id=installation>Installation</h4><p>Running <code>pip install mlx-lm</code> gets us the basic package, and we can actually start playing with models right off the bat with <code>mlx_lm.generate --prompt "Hello"</code>. Starting a continuous chat can be kicked off with <code>mlx_lm.chat</code>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not really sure which model gets used when you don&rsquo;t supply the argument, but providing a <code>--model</code> argument will use the specified model. As mentioned, these should can be repositories on Hugging Face, so to grab the Qwen3 1.7B model as an example, we simply need to run <code>mlx_lm.generate --model qwen/qwen3-1.7b --prompt "Hello"</code>.</p><h4 id=training>Training</h4><p>Now that we&rsquo;re done playing with our toys, it&rsquo;s time to do our best Sid from Toy Story impersonation and start messing with the guts of our models.</p><p><img src=/dev-blog/p/fine-tuning-an-llm/images/sid-workshop.gif width=498 height=373 srcset="/dev-blog/p/fine-tuning-an-llm/images/sid-workshop_hu_fbbb6a160b973de0.gif 480w, /dev-blog/p/fine-tuning-an-llm/images/sid-workshop_hu_81e9558a8a798d9.gif 1024w" loading=lazy class=gallery-image data-flex-grow=133 data-flex-basis=320px></p><p>It&rsquo;s probably a good time to talk about what <em>type</em> of training this is.

And frustratingly, it <em>only</em> happened when I tried to run it via Ollama.</p><p>I was getting some really fun output, where a simple prompt of &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; would return a response along the lines of &ldquo;, I&rsquo;m going to&mldr;&rdquo; and on and on. Noticing the little comma sneaking in there at the start of the response, it took some pain and searching around before I learned all about stop sequences.</p><p>It was only after I spotted someone else showing the output of their model (via <code>ollama show</code>) that I noticed a difference between theirs and mine. Theirs had the <code>TEMPLATE</code> instruction filled in for their Modelfile. I don&rsquo;t know why it hadn&rsquo;t dawned on me earlier, but the example <code>TEMPLATE</code> instruction in the <a class=link href=https://ollama.readthedocs.io/en/modelfile/#template target=_blank rel=noopener>Modelfile reference</a> looked a <em>lot</em> like the <code>template</code> file <a class=link href=https://ollama.com/library/qwen3:1.7b/blobs/ae370d884f10 target=_blank rel=noopener>in the Ollama library</a>.</p><p>Pasting the contents of that file directly into the <code>TEMPLATE</code> instruction of my Modelfile, I was able to get the model to respond as expected. After much pain and suffering, I finally had it working!</p><h4 id=parameters>Parameters</h4><p>While I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how much of a difference it makes, I did also note that running <code>ollama show</code> against the original model had a few parameters set. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure if they were completely necessary, nor what impact they each have — I largely noticed them when I was looking to try and explicitly set my stop sequences via <code>PARAMETER stop &lt;|im_end|></code>.</p><p>Anyhow, I copied the parameter values from the original model&rsquo;s <a class=link href=https://ollama.com/library/qwen3:1.7b/blobs/cff3f395ef37 target=_blank rel=noopener>Ollama library page</a>. Omitting the <code>stop</code> parameters didn&rsquo;t seem to have any impact, but I figured that starting with the remaining values set to those of the original model probably wouldn&rsquo;t be the worst idea.</p><h2 id=results>Results</h2><p>To give everyone a level playing field, I decided to scrap all the models I&rsquo;d been playing with, and really compare these properly. I settled on a consistent set of parameters, and ran the same prompt against each of the models, with the same datasets. I was seeing enough similarity between <strong>LoRA</strong> and <strong>DoRA</strong> training that I didn&rsquo;t feel the need to run both of them against each model, so I decided to just run <strong>Full</strong> and <strong>DoRA</strong> training for each model.</p><p>Each of the models would receive the same prompt, with the response pasted in, giving each model up to three attempts and picking the best response. I&rsquo;ll indicate if this was the case in the results below.</p><p>Here are the datasets used, in the <strong>messages</strong> format:</p><ul><li><a class=link href=files/train.jsonl>train.jsonl</a></li><li><a class=link href=files/valid.jsonl>valid.jsonl</a></li></ul><p>As for the actual parameters, I ran each with <strong>200 iterations</strong> and a <strong>batch size of 1</strong>. For <strong>DoRA</strong> training, I also limited it to training on <strong>4 layers</strong>. This was very focused around reducing the memory usage, as to date I had watched a few training processes crash due to running out of memory. Later on, I do look at the impact of changing the number of layers.</p><h3 id=the-prompt>The prompt</h3><p>The prompt used will be <strong><em>&ldquo;How big is a rugby league field?&rdquo;</em></strong>.</p><p>For reference, the answer is <strong>68m wide</strong>, and <strong>112-122m long</strong>.</p><h3 id=per-model-results>Per-model results</h3><p>In an effort to keep the table headers short, they have been abbreviated.

Perhaps this has something to do with the overall lower number of parameters that the smaller model is working with, resulting in a heavier weighting towards the new values?</p><p>The LLama3.2 model was the only one to nail the response across both sizes, which tracks with the general feeling being that it punches above it&rsquo;s weight. I&rsquo;m not sure that this will translate into writing code where the reasoning capability of Qwen is touted to give it the edge — but I&rsquo;m not quite sure at which model size that benefit really kicks in.</p><p>The larger of the two Llama3.2 models was clearly the winner in terms of balancing the cost of training with the quality of the results. While it had the wrong length for the DoRA-trained model, it got the width right, and both sizes regurgitated the correct dimensions when undergoing full training.</p><p>All this while I was considering whether I had just given the models a garbage dataset, but I decided to forge ahead with some investigation into the number of layers the DoRA training was impacting. Perhaps I could get the balance right between partial and full fine-tuning?</p><h3 id=number-of-layers>Number of layers</h3><p>With Llama3.2&rsquo;s 3B parameter model impressing, I decided to run the experiment with that model (also because it doesn&rsquo;t require the additional conversion step that Qwen does). We can reference the existing results for the four-layer run, and I decided to creep up the layers incrementally.</p><p>I also decided to keep the <strong>Full</strong> result here as the benchmark response.</p><div class=table-wrapper><table><thead><tr><th>Layers</th><th>P%</th><th>TLoss</th><th>VLoss</th><th>Mem (GB)</th><th>Response</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full*</strong></td><td><strong>50.135%</strong></td><td><strong>0.096</strong></td><td><strong>0.193</strong></td><td><strong>15GB</strong></td><td><strong>The size of a rugby league field is between 112 and 122 meters.</strong></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>0.011%</td><td>0.836</td><td>0.911</td><td>7GB</td><td>A rugby league field is 102 meters long and 68 meters wide.

A 3B parameter model is certainly on the smaller end, and the dataset I&rsquo;d given it was likely not very good, but the responses were consistently coming back with reasonably correct dimensions. It was still tripping over a few things, such as not being able to return the correct depth of the in-goal area.</p><p>I decided to offer Qwen a chance at redemption, and ran the same experiment with the 4B model. I was curious to see if it would see similar consistency with a layer number of layers being trained.</p><div class=table-wrapper><table><thead><tr><th>Layers</th><th>P%</th><th>TLoss</th><th>VLoss</th><th>Mem (GB)</th><th>Response</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>4</td><td>0.009%</td><td>1.055</td><td>1.108</td><td>8.5GB</td><td>A rugby league field is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide.

It was spitting out a bunch of relevant info in the thinking output that was clearly from the dataset, but it even with follow-up prompts it couldn&rsquo;t figure out the depth of the in-goal area, nor would it factor that into the total length.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Evidently, I underestimated just how much importance is placed on the dataset itself. I did try throwing some tweaked datasets at the problem, but ran into similar issues. This feels very much like a skill that needs to be honed before I&rsquo;ll truly unlock the potential of fine-tuning.</p><p>In any case, I was pleased to see some success with the smaller models, and I think that the results are promising enough to keep banging away at the problem. I can definitely see the potential for this be used to create a bunch of smaller models that can answer questions about specific domains, so long as the datasets are of reasonable enough quality.</p><p>I was far more impressed by the results of the Llama 3.2 model, although while I was first toying with fine-tuning, I did note that Qwen 3 was consistently better when it came to writing code.</p><p>Based purely on the results posted in here however, it&rsquo;s clear that the <strong>Llama 3.2</strong> model is a great first stop when looking to do any fine-tuning, specifically when fine-tuning <strong>8-16 layers</strong>.</p><h2 id=next-steps>Next steps</h2><p>The next steps for me are following on from a seed that was planted in one of the earliest videos I watched on this topic.</p><p>In the video, the creator formats his responses as <code>&lt;calculator>...&lt;/calculator></code>. The suggestion was, unless I&rsquo;m hallucinating after spending so long buried in AI, that this model could effectively be trained to recognise a maths question and return a response that can hand off the calculation to an actual calculator.</p><div class=video-wrapper><iframe loading=lazy src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yOcUCnLgvt8 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Which got me thinking&mldr; what if instead of a calculator or other tool, we could have a model that called other models?</p><p>Essentially, having a small orchestrator model that can interpret what language, framework, domain etc. the prompt is regarding, and then call the appropriate models to handle each specific task?</p><p>Whether or not that&rsquo;s even a feasible idea is another story entirely, but it certainly feels like learning how to fine-tune a model has only increased my curiosity rather than quenched it.</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/dev-blog/tags/ollama/>Ollama</a>
